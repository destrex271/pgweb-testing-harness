# pgweb-testing-harness
This is the official project repository for the PostgreSQL Website Testing Harness Suite.

## Overview

The PGWeb Testing Harness is a set of tests written for the official PostgreSQL website codebase which can be found [here](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=pgweb.git;a=summary).
The suite utilizes GitHub Actions to run all the tests and generate a log file which can be used to check for bugs in the parts of the codebase covered by the tests.
The tests are divided into the following categories:

- Functional Tests
  - Tests for all forms present on the website.
  - Tests for Documentation loading and rendering processes.
- Accessibility Tests
- Miscellaneous Tests

**Note** :- _Functional Tests have been completed. The other tests are remaining as of now and will be completed in the next few weeks._

## Contributing
To contribute to this project kindly follow the following rules:
- All tests files should be in the format **tests_*.py**
- New Tests should be added via a new branch with the name in format <test_type>/<test_name> where test type can be functional, accessibility and security.
- Kindly refrain from pushing any unwanted files and folders generated by your text editors and IDEs(for eg .idea/ .code/ etc..)

### Setting up the Development Environment

The testing suite can also be run locally. To do so you need the following prerequisites:
- **act** - CLI Tool GitHub Actions Emulation. Installation source can be found [here](https://github.com/nektos/act).
- **Docker** - Required by act to build containers.Installation source can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

After you fork and clone the repository kindly install all the required packages using

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**_We suggest that you do so in a virtual environment to avoid any unnecessary conflicts._**

To run the tests use:

`act -j run-tests`

Once these prerequisites have been satisfied you can follow the contribution instructions given above and write your tests. Be sure to add the  _fixture_teardown() function in the beginning of your tests to avoid unnecessary errors due to Django.

If you are adding new tests kindly add them in the following format: **src/[category]/tests_*.py**.

If you want to add any utility functions kindly add them to **src/utils/*.py**
